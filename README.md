# Sem-2-Project

Visualization Of Space Transformations Using C++

The project is about understanding matricies as geometrical transformations applied on vectors. This project was inspired by the _Essense of Linear Algebra series by 3b1b on youtube_. 

## Some key features

- Window which assists the user to give input in proper format. _Inspired by Rust compiler_.
- Zoom in, zoom out and pan. The user is allowed to see their inputs even if they are out of the screen.
- A message history is maintained using a queue data structure.
- All sorts of mathematical transformations can be visualized like, Rotation, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection, Projection along with basic Vector operations like addition and subtraction.

## Future Plans
- We are now working on making this project into a full blown computer algebra system later.
- To integrate the UI with existing code for LU Decomposition to solve a system of linear equations using Eigen.
- To integrate a Simplex Solver to optimze problems of linear programming.
- Some minor UI bugs to fix.
